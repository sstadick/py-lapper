```

## Usage

```python
from py_lapper import Interval, Lapper, Cursor

intervals = [Interval(0, 5, True), Interval(4, 8, True), Interval(9, 12, True)]
lapper = Lapper(intervals)

found = [iv for iv in lapper.find(4, 7)]
# found = [Interval(0, 5, True), Interval(4, 8, True)]

# Use seek when you will have many queries in sorted order.
cursor = Cursor(0)
found = [iv for iv in lapper.seek(1, 4, cursor)]
# found = [Interval(0, 5, True)]
# cursor = Cursor(2)

found = [iv for iv in lapper.seek(5, 7, cursor)]
# found = [Interval(4, 8, True)]
# cursor = Cursor(3)
```
